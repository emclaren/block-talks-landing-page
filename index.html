        <h4>What is Block Talks</h4>
        <!--   </br> -->
        <p>Block talks is a tangible Augmented Reality toolkit to help kids ages 7-9 learn how to read. It is intended for a semi-supervised environment. There are two modes: </p>
        <p><strong>1. Learning mode</strong> (see demo), children work one-on-one with an educator or parent to learn fundamental spelling skills. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Game mode </strong>(in development), children play with the game on their own to reinforce the skills they worked on with their parent. 
        </p>

        <h4>How it works</h4>

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Blocks Talks consists of a set of physical letters, coloured blocks with physical notch, and an application running in a tablet. 
    </p>

  </br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<p>Children place letters on top of the blocks to make words and sentences. They can then check their spelling, and receive feedback using the tablet application. Feedback consists of an augmented 3D animation of the word or sentence, an audio playback of the word or sentence being read aloud, and a colour-coded sentence structure (for advanced learners).</p>

<p>If there are any grammar mistakes, the application will provide audio/visual feedback. We aim to create an immersive, playful literacy learning experience for children.

</br>
</br>
</br>
<p>Block Talks adapts to children’s skills. It can recognize individual words (for e.g. “cat”, “bird”), and as the child improves it allows them to build more complex sentences (e.g. “the bird can fly”). Coloured blocks are used to represent grammatical structures (e.g: “noun”, “verb”, etc). Magnets connect the letters and blocks so that the letters can be easily place and remove the letters, and reuse them to make various sentences. Physical constraints in the blocks ensure that the blocks can only be connected in a certain order. Colour cues in both physical blocks and digital letters for each part of the sentence so that it will attract children’s attention and help them better understand English grammar.

        <h4>Why does it work</h4>
      </br>

      <p><strong>Supervision is not always needed </strong> - Teachers are busy, and often work with many students at once. Block Talks allows the teacher to engage in learning activities with children one-on-one to develop the basics; but then children can reinforce these lessons independently. This system is also designed to enable free-play and exploration. </p>
      <p><strong>Tangibility matters</strong> - Research shows that children are tactile learners. Using physical objects helps to focus attention on the task, and is a more natural way for children to interact with the world than using a mouse and keyboard. Epistemic actions with tangibles is easier to organize, reorganize, and sort, and makes tasks learning easier.<sup ><a href="#references"> 2-7</a></sup> </p>
      <p><strong>Colour cue</strong> - The main benefit of using colours is to attract attention to the object, and makes it more desirable for the child to play with. Conor cues can also be used to make patterns easier to recognize, and helps individuals focus on grouped structure. <sup> <a href="#references">8-10</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Accessible font</strong> - The typeface used in Block Talks is Century Gothic, an easy-to-read font preferred by literacy experts. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Augment reality </strong>- 3D AR animations make learning to spell fun and interactive. Some concepts are easier to convey using animations instead of static text in workbooks (for example: running vs. walking.) </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Multi-sensory</strong> - Block Talks provides detailed visual/audio feedback to the children so they can improve. Research suggests that having multiple feedback mechanisms, or dual-coding, is beneficial for children’s learning. <sup><a href="#references">11</a></sup></p>
        <p><strong>Based on existing English learning tools</strong> - Block Talks was built with existing childhood English curriculums in mind. It is designed to reinforce fundamental English language concepts in a fun and engaging way. </p>

        <h4>Future Steps</h4>

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Next steps included improving the feedback capability of the AR system, implementing the game mode, and creating a simple stand for the application so the child is free to use both hands while playing with the sentence.
